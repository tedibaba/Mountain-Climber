# 23-S1-A2
Mountain Climber Assignment

## Getting Started

Instructions are extremely similar to those of A1:

* Get a virtual environment up and running
* `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (Replacing python with python3 or py - whatever works)

## Running the GUI

`python main.py`

## Running the Tests

`python run_tests.py`

## Running just some of the Tests

`python run_tests.py 1` will run all tests marked with `@number("1.x")`.
